Tried replacing butter for olive oil and increasing flour by 25g to a total of 150g of flour. Seems ok, crunchy texture.

Molasses replacement seems to be a good choice. It adds color and flavor. (BUT GIVES ME HEARTBURN)

150g flour, no molases, 1 stick soybutter (111g). It was good. The flour made it bready. And the butter is easier to measure.

Brown sugar is just sugar mixed with molasses-- so maybe I should switch to regular white sugar.

Tried stacking dough balls like snowmen to make them tall. This seems to make the cookies taller.
