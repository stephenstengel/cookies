\subsection*{Notes}
Makes about 13 cookies. These should be soft, bready, and not as sweet as most cookies. Do not butter or grease the baking pan. This recipe is the current best batch that I have made. To make more crumbly, buttery cookies, reduce flour to 100g.

%~ HEY: Test with non-brown sugar, brown sugar is just sugar with molasses in it.

%~ Update picture.
